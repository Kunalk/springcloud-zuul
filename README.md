API Gateway, aka Edge Service, provides a unified interface for a set of microservices so that clients no need to know about all the details of microservices internals. However, there are some pros and cons of using API Gateway pattern in microservices architecture.  Pros:  Provides easier interface to clients Can be used to prevent exposing the internal microservices structure to clients Allows to refactor microservices without forcing the clients to refactor consuming logic Can centralize cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring, rate limiting etc Cons:  It could become a single point of failure if proper measures are not taken to make it highly available Knowledge of various microservice API may creep into API Gateway
